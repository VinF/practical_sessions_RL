    "In the following, we will train our reinforcement learning algorithms on classical control problems provided by OpenAI gym. In particular, we will focus on the so-called mountain car problem. In this problem, the agent needs to learn how to drive a car up the right hill, given the constraint that the engine of the car is not strong enough to do so right away. Starting from the bottom of the hill, the agent therefore needs to go back and forth, thereby creating enough momentum, to drive up the mountain. Compared to other classical control problems, this is a quite challenging environment, as the agent never receives a non-negative reward unless the agent reaches the right hill. Thus, most of the time the agent receives a negative reward of -1 which makes learning difficult.\n",
